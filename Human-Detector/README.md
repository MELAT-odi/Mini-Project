# Human Detector

A fun JavaScript project that determines whether a user is human, half-robot, or fully robot based on their answers.

## Project Description

Human Detector is a simple interactive web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The user answers a few questions, and the app calculates a score to determine the final result.

## Features

- Interactive prompts using JavaScript
- Score-based decision system
- Input validation (numbers and yes/no answers)
- DOM manipulation to display results
- Conditional logic (if / else)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

## How It Works

1. User clicks the **Start Test** button.
2. The app asks several questions:
   - Sleep hours per day
   - Enjoy music (yes/no)
   - Get tired (yes/no)
   - Simple math question
3. Each “human-like” answer adds 1 point.
4. Final result:
   - 3–4 → Human
   - 1–2 → Half Robot
   - 0 → Robot

## Concepts Practiced

- Variables
- Data types (string, number, boolean)
- Loops (while)
- Input validation
- Event listeners
- DOM manipulation

## Purpose

This project was created to practice JavaScript fundamentals and conditional logic in a fun and interactive way.
